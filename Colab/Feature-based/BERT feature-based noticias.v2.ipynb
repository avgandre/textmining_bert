FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).\n","  FutureWarning,\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Dados teste\n","\n","with torch.no_grad():\n","    outputs = model(X[0], attention_mask=X[1])\n","\n","cls_embeddings = outputs[0][:, 0, :].numpy()\n","cls_embeddings.shape"],"metadata":{"id":"YYHSPBt3dZtQ","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648049547818,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":475960,"user":{"displayName":"André Vinícius Gonçalves","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhTYQ2yHMybauoyXTTOgRZEVKWq7grg4lMJnyOFLw=s64","userId":"08895061883415001309"}},"outputId":"2e51c01e-08c0-4463-aaab-265826e6d3c7"},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(2594, 768)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":17}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["## test\n","predicted = classifier.predict(cls_embeddings)\n","print(classification_report(yTeste, predicted, labels=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]))"],"metadata":{"id":"biyKXferdGp-","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648049547820,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":81,"user":{"displayName":"André Vinícius Gonçalves","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhTYQ2yHMybauoyXTTOgRZEVKWq7grg4lMJnyOFLw=s64","userId":"08895061883415001309"}},"outputId":"df2fcdfc-ed14-4add-9371-d4033306a639"},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n","\n","           0       0.63      0.71      0.67       452\n","           1       0.54      0.61      0.57       629\n","           2       0.73      0.57      0.64       645\n","           3       0.62      0.30      0.40       600\n","           4       0.35      0.76      0.48       268\n","\n","    accuracy                           0.56      2594\n","   macro avg       0.57      0.59      0.55      2594\n","weighted avg       0.60      0.56      0.56      2594\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(\"\\n--- %.2f minutos ---\" % ((time.time() - tempoInicial) / 60))"],"metadata":{"id":"iUTqIL9odzQx","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648049547821,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":72,"user":{"displayName":"André Vinícius Gonçalves","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhTYQ2yHMybauoyXTTOgRZEVKWq7grg4lMJnyOFLw=s64","userId":"08895061883415001309"}},"outputId":"22fbbf98-88ca-442a-e67c-31380a7e9e41"},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","--- 28.48 minutos ---\n"]}]}]}
